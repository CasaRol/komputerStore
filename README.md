# Computer store

This is the first frotend assignment for the Experis Academy.  
For this assignment we had to create a computer store from which we would be able view aour bank account balance, our loans and be able to work and get paid for this work in order to purchase a computer.

The visuals has not been a priority other than to try out some CSS. The main focus has been the functionality of the page.

Some of the main points:
<ul>
<li>The loan section should be hiddn untill a loan is taken out</li>
<li>You cannot take a loan more than double of your current bank balance</li>
<li>You cannot take out more than one loan before buying a computer</li>
<li>You can only take out one loan at any given time</li>
<li>If you have an outstanding loan, 10% of your salary will go to your debt on payday</li>
</ul>

The entire assignment has been done in plain Javascript, CSS and html without the use of external libraries. These will come in later projects.
